Hi, I am Stefan.

I am currently pursuing my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the
[Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/stefan-appelhoff)
in Berlin:

- How do humans search for information before making a value based choice?
- When do they decide to stop gathering additional information?
- How is active information accumulation different from passive information
  accumulation?

Next to figuring out these questions, I am contributing to the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](bids.neuroimaging.io),
an emerging standard for the organization and documentation of neuroimaging
data. BIDS will help making neuroscience more reproducible by facilitating
(re)use, sanity-checking, and sharing of scientific data.

I am also interested in more technical and concrete problems, such as how to
accurately mark events in an experiment using consumer grade hardware.

Finally, I am a strong proponent of open source software and contribute to
several software packages such as:

- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python)
- [MNE-BIDS](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids)
- [BIDS-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator)
